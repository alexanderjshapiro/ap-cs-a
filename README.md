## Getting Started

These assignments were done using the **BlueJ** IDE, a simple environment for beginners. In any assignment's directory, open `package.bluej` to view the assignment in the IDE. Alternatively, you can copy the files into your IDE of choice and run them there.

Each assignment directory has a subdirectory `Original`. This directory contains an files we were given to start with, as well as the compressed project that we were given to fill out. To complete the exercises yourself, the compressed project contains the uncompleted files.
